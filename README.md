# SPRING BOOT MICROCSERVICE USING SPRING CLOUD, EUREKA, RIBBON, ZUUL

This project is created to get experience on **Microservices With Netflix OSS**. This is a simple project by coded imperative programming with simple business requirements.

ELK Stack has been integrated for monitoring since version 1.1.0.

## There are four microservices:

- **Accounts** : This microservice is responsible for managing accounts. An account could be buyer, seller or an backoffice account but there is only buyer account.
- **Products** : This microservice is responsible for managing products.
- **Orders** : This microservice is responsible for managing orders. It doesn't know anything about account and product except id.
- **Backoffice**: This microservice is provides endpoints for backoffice ui.

Backoffice microservice has an endpoint with path "/api/v1/backoffice/orders". This endpoint return a list of orders with name of product and account. It connects accounts, products and orders 
microservices via **Feign**.

URI for gateway : *http://localhost:8762*

## Used Netflix OSS:

- **Netflix Eureka** is used for discovery service.
- **Netflix Ribbon** is used for client side load-balancing.
- **Netflix Zuul** is used for gateway.

## Used ELK STACK:

- **ElasticSearch** is on 6972 port
- **Logstash TCP** is on 5000 port
- **Kibana** is on 5601 port

## Build & Run

- *>./mvnw clean package -DskipTests* : to build
- *>docker-compose up -d --build* : build docker images and containers and run containers
- *>docker-compose stop* : stop the dockerized services
- Each maven module has a Dockerfile.

In docker-compose.yml file:

- Accounts Service : **__2222__** port is mapped to **__7500__** port of host
